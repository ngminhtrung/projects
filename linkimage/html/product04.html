		<p class="sub-content">Substation transformers transfer the incoming high voltage to the next lower voltage level. As an example, incoming high voltage of 400 kV would be transferred down to 220 kV. In general substation transformers are equipped with on-load-tap changers (OLTC). Incoming transmission lines are connected to the transformers through bushings and cables through cable boxes and cable sealing ends. These transformers are built in core form with auto connected windings, ie common main winding and a separate low voltage winding.</p>
